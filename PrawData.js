        "textContent": "Welcome to **Free Talk** Weekend! There are no specific discussion topics for Weekends. As such, moderation is more relaxed regarding specific and content within the thread. \n\nWhat's on your mind? How's your week in Apex? How have your Apex games been going lately? Want to show off your stats or banners? Need some help or want to give out some pointers? Anything you want to talk about that wasn't brought up in a previous thread or did you miss a specific discussion topic earlier this week? Talk about it here!\n\nThis thread also serves as a group finder!\n\n\nLooking to grind out battle passes or events? How about a squad for some sweaty ranked games? Or maybe you're just looking for a chill bud for casual? If so, look no further!\n\n\nHelpful information to include in your LFG comment:\n\n- Platform\n\n- Username\n\n- Game Mode (casual/duos/ranked/firing range)\n\n- If ranked, what rank?\n\n- Time Zone/Region\n\n- Special requests (chill, sweaty tryhard, mic/no mic, Discord, 1v1, etc..)\n\nAlternatively, you can check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/apexlegends), which has dedicated LFG channels, or our LFG subreddit r/ApexLFG.\n\nModeration in daily threads is more relaxed, but please stay on topic, be respectful of others and remember our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/wiki/rules)\n\n\n---\nGot any feedback for these daily posts? Message [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fapexlegends) with any valid suggestions and feedback!"
